\section{Explain whether the following grammar is ambiguous}
 \begin{align*}
<assignment> &\mapsto <identifier> = <expression>\\
	<identifier> &\mapsto A \\
	 &\mapsto B \\
	 &\mapsto C \\
<expression> &\mapsto <expression> + <expression> \\
	 &\mapsto <expression> + <expression> \\
	 &\mapsto <expression> * <expression> \\
	 &\mapsto <expression> \\
	 &\mapsto <identifier> \\
\end{align*}
\paragraph{Explanation of the problem}, we are trying to determine if the grammar provided will be classified as ambiguous. 
\paragraph{Answer to the problem}
, the statement will be classified as ambiguous. 
This is because the grammar will generate and sentential form with two distinct parse trees. 
\paragraph{Why this matters}
, the complier chooses what code to run based off the size of its parse tree. So when there is ambiguity then the complier has a hard time choosing which code to run because it cannot be determined uniquely.
