\section{A language consists of strings that have n copies of the letter a followed by
the same number of copies of the letter b, where \(n > 0\). Define the grammar
specification for the language.}
\textbf{Answer}
 \begin{align*}
<statement> &\mapsto <letter>b \\
&\mapsto <letter>b, <statement> \\
<letter> &\mapsto A \\
&\mapsto B \\
&\mapsto C \\
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Explanation of the problem} We are given the task of making a recursive language that can take an arbitrary amount of arguments and also add a slight modification to such language. We must remember that whenever the syntax is on the \textbf{LHS} and the \textbf{RHS} of the equation the grammar is recursive. 
\paragraph{Why this matters} Because almost all languages are infinite so we must have a solid understanding on how to recursive recognize the language.
