Loops are kind of what you would expect they have a base loop that builds all the other loops like to while, for and do while loops. 

The packages are made by using the .ads file ending. You call it by specifying `with` then the package name.
Or, you can also just make the whole package avalible by using the `use Week;`

You can have types in Ada of course, and this is where we are getting into what I need for my assignment. Here we have a complex number type that will store my real and imaginary values and print out the values as I need them
