\section{Summary}
After finishing this assignment I had a greater understanding of python than I did coming in. 
Python is rarely a language I use but with the tools learned in the class about how languages are formulated it made it seem easier to but the basic building blocks of language together and use them for my own ends such as in this programming assignment.
